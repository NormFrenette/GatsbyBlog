#### About  

Supporters of this work (via in-app purchases) get access to extra features:
- Network SSID and Password between phone and RPi (secure authentication).  
- "Lock the RPi": so only users with the password (encrypted) can use the BtBerryWifi app to connect to the RPi.
- Extra RPi info: 
    - RPi wifi IP address (encrypted).
    - Mac Addresses of adapters (ethernet, wifi, bluetooth) - (encrypted).
    - Signal strength (dbM) and channel/frequency of available wifi networks (useful for interference analysis) - (encrypted).
    - Other information (user defined) you need to display on the iOS device - (clear text).
