#### About  
**The BTBerryWifi app does not collect any user information, and by extension does not share any data with any third parties.**

The data used by the app is limited to wifi SSID (network name) identified by the connected Raspberry Pi and wifi passwords you may type in the app which are sent to the connected Raspberry Pi over bluetooth.  The data used by the app is only ***live*** while the app is active, and is not stored in any other way: it disappears from your device when you shut down the BTBerryWifi app.  

Behind the scenes, the Apple iPhone app system may generate crash data (should the app crash - I do not expect it to do so!).  This crash data does not contain user information as far as I know and would only be shared with me - the developer.
